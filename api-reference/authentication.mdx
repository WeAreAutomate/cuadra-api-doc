## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens created by Supabase to handle authentication.

### Log In to Get a Token

The easiest way to get an access_token is to log in with a user's email and password via the Supabase Auth endpoint.
You can do this by making a POST request. Here is a cURL example that you can run in your terminal. Replace the placeholder values with your anon key and the user's credentials.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://dguxglyyavnhlugtecgi.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "email": "USER_EMAIL@example.com",
    "password": "USER_PASSWORD"
  }'
```

### Copy Your access_token

If the login is successful, Supabase will return a JSON object containing your access_token. It will look like this:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIU..._YOUR_TOKEN_HERE_...w9Q",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "Abc123_YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE_",
  "user": {
    "id": "cfae92b3-a219-4c12-a84f-b27e1ea2a628",
    "aud": "authenticated",
    "role": "authenticated"
  }
}
```

Copy the access_token to make API calls and securely store the refresh_token. You will need it later.

### Make Authenticated API Requests

You are now ready to make secure calls to our API!
To do this, include the access_token in the Authorization header of your requests as a Bearer token.
Here is an example of how to call a hypothetical API endpoint:

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cuadra.ai/model' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

<Note>
    Your access_token expires after one hour (expires_in: 3600). When it expires, you can use the refresh_token to get a new one without requiring the user to log in again.
</Note>

### Request a New Token

Make a POST request to the token endpoint, this time using refresh_token as the grant_type and passing the refresh_token you saved earlier.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://dguxglyyavnhlugtecgi.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=refresh_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "refresh_token": "THE_REFRESH_TOKEN_YOU_SAVED"
  }'
```
