## Legal Model - ive.legal.1.1.0

The definitive legal language model, architected exclusively for the Spanish judicial framework.

### Description:
Ive-Legal is a state-of-the-art, specialized legal language model, meticulously trained and exclusively focused on the complete corpus of Spanish law and regulation. Unlike generalist AI, its neural architecture is built from the ground up on Spain's hierarchical legal system, from the Constitution and foundational codes (Civil, Penal, etc.) to the latest royal decrees and regional statutes.
It continuously processes and indexes the Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado (BOE), regional official gazettes, and a vast, curated database of jurisprudencia (case law) from the Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, and National High Court. IURIS-IBER is designed not merely to retrieve information, but to understand legal context, interpret statutory cross-references, and provide nuanced analysis, making it an indispensable tool for the modern Spanish legal professional.

### Key Features:
* **Real-Time Legal Monitoring:** Continuously updated with daily publications from the BOE and other official sources to provide up-to-the-minute regulatory awareness.
* **Jurisprudential Analysis:** Capable of identifying, comparing, and summarizing relevant case law to support legal arguments or assess procedural viability.
* **Territorial Competence Navigation:** Uniquely understands the complex division of powers between the state and the Autonomous Communities, accurately distinguishing between state, regional, and local regulations.
* **Statutory Evolution Tracking:** Can trace the legislative history of a specific article or law, showing all modifications, derogations, and corrections over time.
* **Drafting & Validation Assistant:** Assists in drafting legal documents by suggesting standardized clauses, verifying legal citations, and flagging potential inconsistencies based on current law.
